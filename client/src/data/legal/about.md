## Our Story

GymSql was created from a simple realization:

> **People don’t fail SQL interviews because they don’t understand SQL —  
> they fail because they don’t practice enough real-world SQL.**

We set out to bridge that gap by building a platform where anyone can:

- Practice interview-style problems
- Think like data professionals
- Gain confidence in real database scenarios
- Continuously improve with measurable progress

GymSql is built **by data engineers for data learners** — and we’re just getting started.
