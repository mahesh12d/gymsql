## Our Story

SQLGym was born from a simple observation: traditional SQL courses teach theory, but employers want practical skills. We saw talented developers struggle in technical interviews not because they didn't understand SQL, but because they lacked practice with real-world problems.

We set out to bridge that gap by creating a platform that combines:

- The rigor of coding interview platforms
- The depth of SQL-specific challenges
- The community of collaborative learning
- The structure of progressive skill development

## The Technology

SQLGym runs on a modern, production-grade technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for a responsive, interactive experience
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- **Execution**: DuckDB sandboxes for secure, isolated SQL query execution
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run for scalable, reliable hosting

## Who We Serve

SQLGym is designed for:

- **Job Seekers**: Preparing for data analyst, data engineer, or backend developer interviews
- **Students**: Learning SQL for coursework or personal development
- **Professionals**: Sharpening their SQL skills or learning advanced techniques
- **Bootcamp Grads**: Building practical experience to complement their education
- **Career Changers**: Transitioning into data-focused roles
