# SQLGym Platform - Production Security Implementation

## Security Features Implemented (Option A: Simple & Secure for Single Admin)

### ‚úÖ Completed Security Features

1. **Rate Limiting Service** (`api/rate_limiter.py`)
   - SlowAPI integration with Redis backend
   - 5 login attempts per hour limit
   - Automatic IP lockout after 5 failed attempts (1 hour lockout)
   - Failed attempt tracking per IP address
   - Integrated with admin session endpoint (`/api/admin/session`)

2. **Audit Logging Service** (`api/audit_logger.py`)
   - Comprehensive logging of all admin actions
   - Stores in Redis with 90-day retention
   - Tracks: user_id, action, timestamp, IP address, user agent, metadata
   - Logs both successful and failed admin actions
   - Integrated with admin authentication

3. **Security Middleware** (`api/security_middleware.py`)
   - **SecurityHeadersMiddleware**: Adds CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy
   - **IPWhitelistMiddleware**: Optional IP whitelisting (via ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS env var)
   - **AdminRequestLoggingMiddleware**: Logs all admin API requests for monitoring

4. **Admin Authentication Integration** (`api/auth.py`)
   - Rate limiting on `verify_admin_user_access` function
   - IP lockout checks before authentication
   - Failed attempt recording for invalid credentials
   - Clear failed attempts on successful authentication
   - Audit logging for access attempts and denials

5. **Admin Session Endpoint Security** (`api/admin_routes.py`)
   - `/api/admin/session` endpoint fully secured with:
     - Lockout dependency (blocks if IP is locked out)
     - Rate limiting (5 attempts/hour)
     - Audit logging (successful and failed attempts)
     - Failed attempt recording
     - IP address tracking

6. **Production Documentation**
   - `PRODUCTION_SECURITY_GUIDE.md`: Complete guide for deploying to Google Cloud Run
   - Covers: Secret Manager setup, IP whitelisting, monitoring, troubleshooting
   - `replit.md`: Updated with security features documentation

### üîí Security Checklist

- [x] Rate limiting implemented and tested
- [x] IP lockout mechanism working
- [x] Audit logging capturing admin actions
- [x] Security headers applied to all responses
- [x] IP whitelisting capability (optional)
- [x] Admin session endpoint secured
- [x] Production deployment guide created
- [x] Documentation updated

### üìã What's Implemented

**For Single Admin Setup:**
- Strong ADMIN_SECRET_KEY (64+ characters)
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Automatic IP lockout after failed attempts
- Comprehensive audit logging with 90-day retention
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Optional IP whitelisting
- Production deployment guide with Google Cloud Run + Secret Manager

### üöÄ Deployment Ready

The system is now production-ready for a single administrator. Follow `PRODUCTION_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` for deployment instructions.

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use Google Secret Manager for all secrets
- Generate strong ADMIN_SECRET_KEY (64+ characters)
- Enable IP whitelisting if you have static IP
- Monitor audit logs regularly
- Rotate ADMIN_SECRET_KEY every 90 days

### üìù Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `api/rate_limiter.py` - Rate limiting service with SlowAPI
- `api/audit_logger.py` - Audit logging service with Redis
- `api/security_middleware.py` - Security headers and IP whitelisting
- `PRODUCTION_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Production deployment guide

**Modified Files:**
- `api/main.py` - Added security middleware to FastAPI app
- `api/auth.py` - Integrated rate limiting and audit logging
- `api/admin_routes.py` - Secured admin session endpoint
- `replit.md` - Updated with security documentation

### ‚úÖ Status: PRODUCTION READY

All security features have been implemented and tested. The application is ready for production deployment with robust security for a single administrator.
