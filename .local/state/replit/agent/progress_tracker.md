## Cloud Run Admin 403 Forbidden Errors Fix

### Issue
403 Forbidden errors in Cloud Run for all admin endpoints:
- POST `/api/admin/problems` (create problem)
- POST `/api/admin/convert-parquet` (parse parquet solution)
- And all other admin endpoints using `apiRequest` or query client

### Root Cause
The `apiRequest` function and `getQueryFn` in `queryClient.ts` were only sending the JWT token via `Authorization: Bearer` header, but were NOT sending the `X-Admin-Session` header required for admin authentication.

- AdminContext.tsx correctly uses `getAdminHeaders()` helper that includes `X-Admin-Session`
- BUT CreateQuestionTab.tsx and other components use `apiRequest()` which didn't include admin session token
- Backend rejects requests without `X-Admin-Session` header with 403 Forbidden

### Solution Implemented

[x] 1. Updated queryClient.ts to auto-include admin session token
   - Modified `apiRequest()` to check if URL includes `/api/admin`
   - If yes, automatically adds `X-Admin-Session` header from sessionStorage
   - Modified `getQueryFn()` with same logic for query requests
   - Now ALL admin API calls automatically include the session token
   - **FIXED** ‚úÖ

[x] 2. Fixed SolutionsTab.tsx to use correct header
   - Changed `'X-Admin-Key': state.adminKey` to `'X-Admin-Session': state.adminKey`
   - Updated both fetch calls (lines 59 and 84)
   - Now correctly sends session token using `X-Admin-Session` header
   - **FIXED** ‚úÖ

### Current Issue - Session Token Expiration

**Symptom**: User still getting 403 errors when creating problems or parsing parquet files

**Cause**: Admin session tokens expire after 30 minutes and are stored in sessionStorage (which clears on tab close/refresh)

**Solution**: 
1. Log out of admin panel and log back in to get a fresh session token
2. Session tokens are automatically stored in sessionStorage
3. All admin API calls now automatically include the session token
4. If you get 403 errors again, simply re-authenticate in the admin panel

## Cloud Run Admin Validation Error Fix

### Issue
Pydantic ValidationError when creating/updating solutions, parsing parquet files, and creating questions in Cloud Run.
Error message: "Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON"

### Root Cause
- Backend was throwing unhandled Pydantic validation errors during `SolutionResponse.from_orm()` serialization
- FastAPI error handler was returning plain text "Internal Server Error" instead of JSON
- No detailed logging to diagnose the root cause of validation failures

### Solution Implemented

[x] 1. Added comprehensive error handling to solution endpoints
   - Wrapped all `SolutionResponse` serialization in try-except blocks
   - Changed from `from_orm()` to `model_validate()` (Pydantic v2 recommended method)
   - Added detailed error logging including solution data and creator data
   - Now returns proper JSON error responses with details: `{"detail": "Failed to serialize solution: <error>"}`
   - Updated endpoints: create_or_update_solution, get_problem_solution, get_problem_solutions, update_solution
   - **FIXED** ‚úÖ

## Google Cloud Run Build Error Fix

### Issue
Build failed during Google Cloud Run deployment with error:
```
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"
```

### Root Cause
- Vite configuration had `root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client")` but build wasn't explicitly specifying the entry point
- Docker build process couldn't resolve the correct path to index.html

### Solutions Implemented

[x] 1. First attempt - Added explicit rollupOptions.input with relative path
   - Added `rollupOptions.input: path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html")`
   - Worked locally but failed in Docker environment ‚ùå

[x] 2. Second attempt - Switched to relative paths only  
   - Changed to `root: "client"` and `outDir: "../dist/public"`
   - Removed explicit rollupOptions.input
   - Worked locally but still failed in Docker ‚ùå

[x] 3. Third attempt - Combination of relative root + absolute input
   - `root: "client"` (relative)
   - `outDir: "../dist/public"` (relative)
   - `rollupOptions.input: path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html")` (absolute)
   - Build completes successfully locally in ~32s ‚úÖ
   - **FAILED in Docker**: client/ directory not being copied ‚ùå

[x] 4. Fourth attempt - Explicit directory copying in Dockerfile
   - Changed Dockerfile from `COPY . .` to explicit directory copies
   - `COPY client ./client`, `COPY api ./api`, etc.
   - Added comprehensive debug verification steps
   - Build completes successfully locally in ~32s ‚úÖ
   - **FAILED in Cloud Build**: `client/` excluded by `.gcloudignore` ‚ùå

[x] 5. Fifth attempt - Fixed .gcloudignore file (FINAL SOLUTION) ‚úÖ
   - Discovered `.gcloudignore` was excluding `client/` and `attached_assets/` directories
   - Removed these exclusions from `.gcloudignore`
   - Now all necessary directories will be uploaded to Google Cloud Build
   - **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** üöÄ

## Previous Fixes (Completed)

[x] 3. Fixed UserResponse schema in Replit
   - Added `is_admin: bool = False` field to `api/schemas.py`
   - Backend now properly sends admin status to frontend
   - Admin panel access working in Replit ‚úÖ

[x] 4. Updated Dockerfile for Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Added Node.js 20.x installation
   - Simplified package dependency handling (only requires package.json)
   - Added frontend build step (`npm run build`)
   - Fixed COPY order to avoid package-lock.json errors
   
[x] 5. Configured FastAPI to serve static files and handle SPA routing
   - Added StaticFiles mounting for /assets directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve index.html for non-API routes
   - Ensures proper routing for admin panel and all client-side routes

## Deployment Instructions

### For Google Cloud Run:
```bash
# Deploy to staging
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml

# Or deploy to production
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.prod.yaml
```
