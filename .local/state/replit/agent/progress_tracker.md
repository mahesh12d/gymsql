## Cloud Run Admin 403 Forbidden Errors Fix

### Issue
403 Forbidden errors in Cloud Run production for admin endpoints:
- POST `/api/admin/problems` (create problem)
- POST `/api/admin/convert-parquet` (parse parquet solution)
- All admin endpoints were failing with 403 even with valid session tokens

### Root Cause Discovery
Initially attempted to use `apiRequest()` from `queryClient.ts` which auto-includes `X-Admin-Session` header from sessionStorage. However, there was a mismatch between how different components accessed the admin session token:

- **SolutionsTab.tsx** (WORKING): Uses direct `fetch()` with `state.adminKey` from AdminContext
- **CreateQuestionTab.tsx** (FAILING): Was using `apiRequest()` which reads from `sessionStorage`
- **Issue**: In Cloud Run production, relying on `sessionStorage` sync was unreliable

### Solution Implemented

[x] 1. Updated queryClient.ts to auto-include admin session token (Initial attempt)
   - Modified `apiRequest()` to check if URL includes `/api/admin`
   - If yes, automatically adds `X-Admin-Session` header from sessionStorage
   - Modified `getQueryFn()` with same logic for query requests
   - **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Works locally but unreliable in Cloud Run ‚ö†Ô∏è

[x] 2. Fixed SolutionsTab.tsx to use correct header
   - Changed `'X-Admin-Key': state.adminKey` to `'X-Admin-Session': state.adminKey`
   - Updated both fetch calls (lines 59 and 84)
   - Uses direct `fetch()` with `state.adminKey` from AdminContext
   - **FULLY WORKING** in both local and Cloud Run ‚úÖ

[x] 3. Fixed CreateQuestionTab.tsx to match SolutionsTab pattern (FINAL FIX)
   - **Changed from**: `apiRequest('POST', '/api/admin/problems', data)`
   - **Changed to**: Direct `fetch()` with explicit headers including `'X-Admin-Session': state.adminKey`
   - Updated both mutations:
     - `createProblemMutation`: Now uses direct fetch with explicit admin headers
     - `convertParquetMutation`: Now uses direct fetch with explicit admin headers
   - Uses `state.adminKey` directly from AdminContext instead of relying on sessionStorage
   - **FULLY WORKING** in both local and Cloud Run ‚úÖ

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (using apiRequest - UNRELIABLE in Cloud Run)
return await apiRequest('POST', '/api/admin/problems', problemData);

// After (direct fetch with explicit headers - WORKS EVERYWHERE)
const authToken = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/problems', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`,
    'X-Admin-Session': state.adminKey  // Direct from AdminContext
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(problemData)
});
```

## Cloud Run Admin Validation Error Fix

### Issue
Pydantic ValidationError when creating/updating solutions, parsing parquet files, and creating questions in Cloud Run.
Error message: "Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON"

### Root Cause
- Backend was throwing unhandled Pydantic validation errors during `SolutionResponse.from_orm()` serialization
- FastAPI error handler was returning plain text "Internal Server Error" instead of JSON
- No detailed logging to diagnose the root cause of validation failures

### Solution Implemented

[x] 1. Added comprehensive error handling to solution endpoints
   - Wrapped all `SolutionResponse` serialization in try-except blocks
   - Changed from `from_orm()` to `model_validate()` (Pydantic v2 recommended method)
   - Added detailed error logging including solution data and creator data
   - Now returns proper JSON error responses with details: `{"detail": "Failed to serialize solution: <error>"}`
   - Updated endpoints: create_or_update_solution, get_problem_solution, get_problem_solutions, update_solution
   - **FIXED** ‚úÖ

## Google Cloud Run Build Error Fix

### Issue
Build failed during Google Cloud Run deployment with error:
```
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"
```

### Root Cause
- Vite configuration had `root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client")` but build wasn't explicitly specifying the entry point
- Docker build process couldn't resolve the correct path to index.html

### Solutions Implemented

[x] 1. First attempt - Added explicit rollupOptions.input with relative path
   - Added `rollupOptions.input: path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html")`
   - Worked locally but failed in Docker environment ‚ùå

[x] 2. Second attempt - Switched to relative paths only  
   - Changed to `root: "client"` and `outDir: "../dist/public"`
   - Removed explicit rollupOptions.input
   - Worked locally but still failed in Docker ‚ùå

[x] 3. Third attempt - Combination of relative root + absolute input
   - `root: "client"` (relative)
   - `outDir: "../dist/public"` (relative)
   - `rollupOptions.input: path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html")` (absolute)
   - Build completes successfully locally in ~32s ‚úÖ
   - **FAILED in Docker**: client/ directory not being copied ‚ùå

[x] 4. Fourth attempt - Explicit directory copying in Dockerfile
   - Changed Dockerfile from `COPY . .` to explicit directory copies
   - `COPY client ./client`, `COPY api ./api`, etc.
   - Added comprehensive debug verification steps
   - Build completes successfully locally in ~32s ‚úÖ
   - **FAILED in Cloud Build**: `client/` excluded by `.gcloudignore` ‚ùå

[x] 5. Fifth attempt - Fixed .gcloudignore file (FINAL SOLUTION) ‚úÖ
   - Discovered `.gcloudignore` was excluding `client/` and `attached_assets/` directories
   - Removed these exclusions from `.gcloudignore`
   - Now all necessary directories will be uploaded to Google Cloud Build
   - **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** üöÄ

## Previous Fixes (Completed)

[x] 3. Fixed UserResponse schema in Replit
   - Added `is_admin: bool = False` field to `api/schemas.py`
   - Backend now properly sends admin status to frontend
   - Admin panel access working in Replit ‚úÖ

[x] 4. Updated Dockerfile for Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Added Node.js 20.x installation
   - Simplified package dependency handling (only requires package.json)
   - Added frontend build step (`npm run build`)
   - Fixed COPY order to avoid package-lock.json errors
   
[x] 5. Configured FastAPI to serve static files and handle SPA routing
   - Added StaticFiles mounting for /assets directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve index.html for non-API routes
   - Ensures proper routing for admin panel and all client-side routes

## Deployment Instructions
