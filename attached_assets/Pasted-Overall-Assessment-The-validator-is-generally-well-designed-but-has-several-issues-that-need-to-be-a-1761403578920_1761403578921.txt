Overall Assessment
The validator is generally well-designed but has several issues that need to be addressed:
Critical Issues
1. Hash-Based Comparison is Flawed
pythondef _row_hash(self, row: Dict[str, Any]) -> int:
    return hash(tuple(sorted((k, str(v) if v is not None else None)
                       for k, v in row.items())))
Problem: Converting everything to strings means 123 and "123" will hash identically, causing false positives.
Fix: Use proper type-aware hashing:
pythondef _row_hash(self, row: Dict[str, Any]) -> int:
    def hashable_value(v):
        if v is None:
            return (None,)
        if isinstance(v, (int, float, str, bool)):
            return (type(v).__name__, v)
        if isinstance(v, (datetime, date)):
            return ('datetime', v.isoformat())
        return (type(v).__name__, str(v))
    
    return hash(tuple(sorted((k, hashable_value(v)) for k, v in row.items())))
2. Numeric Tolerance Defined But Never Used
pythonself.numeric_tolerance = 0.001  # Declared but never used!
The _rows_equal_fast method doesn't handle floating-point comparisons with tolerance. This will cause failures for legitimate floating-point rounding differences.
Fix: Add numeric tolerance checking:
pythondef _rows_equal_fast(self, row1: Dict[str, Any], row2: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    if len(row1) != len(row2):
        return False

    for key in row2:
        if key not in row1:
            return False

        val1, val2 = row1[key], row2[key]

        if val1 is None and val2 is None:
            continue
        if val1 is None or val2 is None:
            return False

        # Handle numeric comparison with tolerance
        if isinstance(val1, (int, float)) and isinstance(val2, (int, float)):
            if abs(float(val1) - float(val2)) > self.numeric_tolerance:
                return False
        elif type(val1) != type(val2):
            if str(val1).strip() != str(val2).strip():
                return False
        elif val1 != val2:
            return False

    return True
3. Type Coercion Can Hide Bugs
pythonif type(val1) != type(val2):
    if str(val1).strip() != str(val2).strip():
        return False
This silently converts types, making 123 equal to "123". This might hide data type issues in student queries.
Recommendation: Make this configurable or at least log warnings when type coercion occurs.
Performance Issues
4. Inefficient Set Operations for Small Datasets
pythondef _validate_small_dataset(self, actual, expected, comparison_mode, result):
    actual_tuples = {tuple(sorted(row.items())) for row in actual}
Converting dicts to sorted tuples is expensive. For small datasets (â‰¤10 rows), direct comparison would be faster.
5. Early Termination Logic Questionable
pythonfor i in range(max_checks):
    if self._rows_equal_fast(actual[i], expected[i]):
        matches += 1
    elif matches == 0 and i > 5:  # Early termination
        break
This will give up after checking 6 rows if none match, which could miss patterns in larger datasets.
Logic Issues
6. Score Calculation Inconsistency
pythondef _calculate_final_score(self, structure_score: float, content_score: float, context: FeedbackContext) -> float:
    if context.user_level == "beginner":
        return structure_score * 0.4 + content_score * 0.6
    else:
        return structure_score * 0.3 + content_score * 0.7
Problem: Structure score is calculated from 0-100, content score is also 0-100, but they're weighted separately. If structure is 100 and content is 0, beginners get 40 points for wrong data!
Recommendation: Content accuracy should be required for any passing score.
7. Extrapolation for Large Datasets is Risky
pythonif len(expected) > max_checks:
    match_ratio = matches / max_checks if max_checks > 0 else 0.0
Checking only the first 100 rows and extrapolating could miss errors in later rows.
Minor Issues
8. Missing FUZZY and SUBSET Comparison Modes
The ComparisonMode enum defines FUZZY and SUBSET, but they're never implemented.
9. ErrorCategory Enum is Unused
Defined but never referenced in the code.
10. Inconsistent Feedback Messages
Some use emojis (ðŸ’¡), some don't. Consider making this consistent or user-configurable.
