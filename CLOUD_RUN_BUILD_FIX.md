# Google Cloud Run Build Error - FIXED ✅

## Issue
Deployment to Google Cloud Run failed with the following error:
```
✗ Build failed in 15ms
error during build:
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html".
```

## Root Cause
The Vite configuration had `root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client")` which sets the project root to the `client/` directory. However, the build process wasn't explicitly specifying the entry point for Rollup, causing path resolution issues during the Docker build.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vite.config.ts`
Added explicit entry point specification in the build configuration:

```typescript
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist", "public"),
  emptyOutDir: true,
  rollupOptions: {
    input: path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html"),
  },
},
```

### 2. Updated `package.json`
Made the build command more explicit:

```json
"build": "vite build --config vite.config.ts"
```

## Verification

Build now completes successfully:
```
✓ 3424 modules transformed.
✓ built in 34.64s

Output:
- dist/public/index.html (2.33 kB)
- dist/public/assets/index-CHrvGRYc.css (95.31 kB)
- dist/public/assets/index-DHJJ63Pw.js (2.8 MB)
```

## Testing Locally

You can verify the build works:

```bash
# Clean previous build
rm -rf dist

# Run build
npm run build

# Check output
ls -la dist/public/
```

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run

Now you can deploy successfully:

```bash
# Option 1: Deploy from local machine
gcloud run deploy sqlgym-backend \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 1Gi

# Option 2: Use Cloud Build (recommended)
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml
```

## What Changed?

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `vite.config.ts` | Added `rollupOptions.input` | Explicitly specifies entry point for Rollup bundler |
| `package.json` | Updated build script to include `--config` flag | Ensures vite.config.ts is always loaded |

## Build Output Structure

```
dist/
└── public/
    ├── index.html
    └── assets/
        ├── index-CHrvGRYc.css
        ├── index-DHJJ63Pw.js
        └── [other static assets]
```

This structure is correctly served by FastAPI in production via:
- `/assets/*` → Static file serving
- All other routes → `index.html` (SPA routing)

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All build issues have been resolved. Your application is now ready to be deployed to Google Cloud Run.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to staging** (recommended first):
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml
   ```

2. **Test the deployment**:
   - Visit the Cloud Run URL
   - Check all routes work (admin panel, problems, etc.)
   - Verify frontend assets load correctly

3. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.prod.yaml
   ```
