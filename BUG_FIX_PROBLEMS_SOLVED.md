# User Progress Tracking Bug Fix - October 26, 2025

## 🐛 Issue
Users were solving problems, but their profile always showed **"0 Problems Solved"**.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `track_successful_submission()` function only updated the Redis leaderboard cache, but **never updated the PostgreSQL database**. Since the profile page reads from PostgreSQL, users never saw their progress.

## ✅ Fix Implemented

### 1. Updated Database Tracking
**File:** `api/main.py` - `track_successful_submission()` function

The function now:
- ✅ Updates PostgreSQL `users.problems_solved` when a user solves a problem for the first time
- ✅ Commits both `ProblemSession` and `User` updates in a single transaction
- ✅ Only updates Redis cache AFTER the database write succeeds
- ✅ Raises an error if the user is not found (prevents silent data drift)

**PostgreSQL is now the source of truth. Redis is just a cache.**

### 2. Created Admin Backfill Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/backfill-problems-solved`

This endpoint fixes existing users' progress by:
- Counting completed problems from the `problem_sessions` table
- Updating each user's `problems_solved` count in the database
- Returning statistics about how many users were updated

## 📋 How to Fix Existing Data (For Admins)

If you have users who already solved problems before this fix:

1. **Login to the admin panel** (you need admin credentials)

2. **Call the backfill endpoint** using the admin panel or API:
   ```
   POST /api/admin/backfill-problems-solved
   ```
   
3. **You'll get a response like this:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Backfill complete: 15 users updated out of 50",
     "total_users": 50,
     "users_updated": 15,
     "users_unchanged": 35,
     "updates": [
       {"username": "john_doe", "old_count": 0, "new_count": 3},
       {"username": "jane_smith", "old_count": 0, "new_count": 7}
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Sync the Redis leaderboard** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   POST /api/admin/sync-leaderboard
   ```

5. **Check user profiles** - they should now show the correct problems solved count!

## 🔄 For New Submissions

**No action needed!** The fix automatically tracks progress going forward. Every time a user solves a problem:
1. PostgreSQL `users.problems_solved` increments
2. Redis leaderboard updates
3. Profile page immediately shows the correct count

## ✅ Architect Approved

This fix has been reviewed and approved by the architect agent as **production-ready**.

**Key improvements:**
- Transaction handling is correct
- Error handling prevents silent failures
- Data consistency between PostgreSQL and Redis
- No security concerns

## 📊 Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ Profile always showed 0 problems solved
- ❌ Users couldn't track their learning progress

**After:**
- ✅ Profile shows correct problems solved count
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Leaderboard stays in sync with database

---

**Status:** 🎉 **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

Your users can now see their progress update in real-time as they solve problems!
